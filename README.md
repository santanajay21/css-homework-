# css-homework-
This is just some css homework to start sharpening my css skills. In this homework I had to look at the difference between the four categories that determine the level of importance when it comes to css rules. The four catagories are position, specificty, type, and importance. I will continue to upload and document my progress. I want to continue the habbit of uploading on git hub as much as possible.
